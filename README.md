# Popular-Movies-Stage-2
Android ND Stage 2 of the Popular Movies App

To build and run this app, you'll need an API key from themoviedb.org.

First, sign up to themoviedb.org https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

Then select API from the menu on the left hand side and follow to create your own API key.

Next up in our code files, add  your API key to the code by adding the following to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file:
  
MyTheMovieDbApiKey="[Your API key]"

Just replace it by YOUR_OWN_API_KEY and you would be good to go.
